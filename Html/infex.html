    <p><b>Light</b>
    <br>
    (Q1) Write the laws of reflection ?
    <br><br>
    Ans :Law of reflection is defined as: The principle when the light rays fall on the smooth surface, the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence, also the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the surface all lie in the same plane.
    <br><br>
    (Q2) Difference between Regular & Diffussed reflection ? 
    <br><br>
    Ans :In regular reflection, all reflected rays are parallel to each other for parallel incident rays but in diffused reflection, the reflected rays are not parallel to each other for parallel incident rays. 
     <br><br>
    (Q3) What do you mean by reflected ray ?
    <br><br>
     Ans :The ray of light that bounces back from the surface of reflection is called the reflected ray. All the rays, the incident ray, normal and reflected ray, lie on the same plane.

    (Q4) Write for 4 characteristics formed in plane mirror ?
    <br><br>
     Ans :The image formed by a plane mirror is always virtual and erect. The size of the image is equal to that of the object. The image formed is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. The image is laterally inverted.
     <br><br>
    (Q5) What is lateral inversion ?
    <br><br>
     Ans :When the image of an object is erect but is inverted in the lateral side, it is called lateral inversion. Example: Image formed by plane mirrors are laterally inverted, i.e., the left side comes to the right and the right comes to the left.
      <br><br>
    (Q6) Difference between rod cells and cone cells?
    <br><br>
    Ans :Rods are responsible for vision at low light levels (scotopic vision). They do not mediate color vision, and have a low spatial acuity. Cones are active at higher light levels (photopic vision), are capable of color vision and are responsible for high spatial acuity. The central fovea is populated exclusively by Cones.
    <br><br>
    (Q7) Write some common eye problem in human ?
    <br><br>
    Ans :Refractive errors include myopia (near-sightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism (distorted vision at all distances), and presbyopia that occurs between age 40-50 years (loss of the ability to focus up close, inability to read letters of the phone book, need to hold newspaper farther away to see clearly).

   <p> <b>Some Natural Phenomen</b> <br>
    (Q1) Suggest 3 major to protect yourself from lightning ?
   <br><br>
   Ans :While lightning we should stay in a closed place preferably in a closed room or car. We should avoid taking shelter under trees or standing in an open field while lightning. Electric wire, telephone lines, and metal surfaces should never be touched while lightning.
     <br><br>
    (Q2) Explain why a charge body loses it charge when we touch ?
   <br><br>
    (Q3) Why a charge ballon repplel another charge ballon where as it attract uncharge ballon ? 
   <br><br>
    (Q4) Write 4 major precation whould you take to protect yourself during an Earthquake ?
   <br><br>
    (Q5) Why does plastic comb rub with dry hair it attract tiny pices of paper ?
   <br><br>
    (Q6) what do you mean by lightning conductor ? 
    </p><br>
    <p><b>Sound</b><br>
     (Q1) How does sound of a bird difference from rour of a lion ?
     <br><br>
     (Q2) What frequency can dog hear but humans not ? 
     <br><br>
     (Q3) Why are the voice box of of a child , men & women is diffrent ? 
     <br><br>
     (Q4) Explain in what way noise pollution harmful to human ?
     <br><br>
     (Q5) How do we hear ?
