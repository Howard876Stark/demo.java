    <p>Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is a programming language used to describe the structure of web pages. HTML
        makes it possible to create static pages with text, headings, tables, lists, images, links, and so on.
        <br><br>
        HTML is the primary markup language found on the internet. Every HTML page has a series of elements that create
        the content structure of a web page or application.
        <br><br>
        HTML is a beginner-friendly language with plenty of support and is mainly used for static website pages. HTML
        works best together with CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality. You can check out how to link CSS and
